# Self-Hosting Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own instance of ForwardDomain. This is not a guide for setting up a development environment, but rather a guide for setting up a production instance.

## Prerequisites

- `node` LTS node (20.x or Higher)
- `openssl` required for signing certs
- `go` (>= 1.22) for running tests
- `find`, `grep`, `wc` (linux standard tools) for running stats
- A machine with public IP address installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/willnode/forward-domain.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values
4. Run the app: `npm start`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
`HTTP_PORT` | The port to listen for HTTP requests
`HTTPS_PORT` | The port to listen for HTTPS requests
`STAT_PORT` | The port to listen for getting API metrics
`WHITELIST_HOSTS` | A comma-separated list of root domains to whitelist
`BLACKLIST_HOSTS` | A comma-separated list of root domains to blacklist
`BLACKLIST_REDIRECT` | The URL to redirect to when a blacklisted host is accessed
`OPENSSL_BIN` | (used by `pem` package) Path to `openssl` to override from PATH

If `WHITELIST_HOSTS` is set, `BLACKLIST_HOSTS` is ignored. Both is mutually exclusive.

If `BLACKLIST_REDIRECT` empty or unset, it will not attempt to generate certificates on HTTPS (resulting "alert handshake failure" closing connection immediately) or return 403 on HTTP. It's recommended to leave this blank if `WHITELIST_HOSTS` is set.

### Startup Files

+ `app.js` This is the startup file for production, listening on both `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTPS_PORT`.
+ `index.js` This is for development or testing only, listening to only `HTTP_PORT` on main or exporting the module.
+ `stat.js` A simple background service [for providing stat](https://s.forwarddomain.net) listening to `STAT_PORT`. 

### SSL Certificates

SSL certificates is saved in `./.certs` directory. No additional configuration is needed. 

## Running the App

`sudo npm start` is recommended to run the app. This is because the app needs to listen to port 80 and 443 directly, which requires root access.

If you want to run the app without root access, or wanted to filter some domains for other services, you have to use NGINX with stream plugin.

## NGINX + Stream Plugin

You cannot run this server via regular NGINX's `server` directive because that's mean you won't get benefited from automatic HTTPS cert installation and only-DNS-needed setup approach.

[NGINX Stream plugin](http://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) is used to filter some domain while still be able forwards HTTPS connection directly. It has to be that way since NGINX doesn't handle HTTPS certificates.

This configuration below, setups the following:
+ Port `80` is listened by `http` block, with default site forwards connection to port `5080`.
+ Port `443` is listened by `stream` block, with default stream forwards connection to port `5443`.
+ All normal HTTPS connection in `http` block listen to `6443`, to be cached by some domains in `stream` block.
+ Port `5080` and `5443` and `5900` for http, https and stat is set for `forward-domain` service listened to.
