This service forwards domains using HTTP(s) redirects.

Example scenarios:

+ Forward non-www to www domains or vice versa
+ Forward old domains to new domains

Why using this service?

+ No coding required
+ No hosting required
+ No registration required
+ Completely anonymous
+ Completely free

How does it works?

+ Point your domain to us using CNAME or A/AAAA records
+ Tell us where to forward using TXT records
+ We handle HTTPS certificates for you

## Get Started

To forward from `www.old.com` to `old.com`, add these records to your DNS:

```
www.old.com     IN    CNAME   r.forwarddomain.net
_.www.old.com   IN    TXT     forward-domain=https://old.com/*
```

Because CNAME can't be used in apex domains, you can use A/AAAA records.<br>
To forward from `old.com` to `new.net`, add these records to your DNS:

```
old.com     IN    A       167.172.5.31
_.old.com   IN    TXT     forward-domain=https://new.net/*
```

The star `*` at the end tells us that the remaining URL path is also forwarded to the destination URL.

> If you use Cloudflare or any DNS which supports [CNAME Flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/), you still can use CNAME records pointing to `r.forwarddomain.net`. It's recommended to use CNAME records rather than A/AAAA records.

You can choose the type of redirection you want to use by declaring the `http-status` value:

```
www.old.com     IN    CNAME   r.forwarddomain.net
_.www.old.com   IN    TXT     http-status=302;forward-domain=https://old.com/*
```

> Only the HTTP status code 301 and 302 are supported. By default it's 301, which is permanent redirection. Set to 302 if you want temporary redirection, it has effect on search engine indexing.

## FAQ

### Is it really free?

Forwarding domains should be easy to setup.<br>
I use this myself for [domcloud.io](https://domcloud.io).<br>

### How can I check redirects will work?

This service uses Google's [Public DNS Resolver](https://dns.google).<br>
Once first accessed, values will be cached for a day.<br>
For right now there's no way to flush the cache sorry.

### Why it loads slowly?

It only slow at first time because it has to sign HTTPS certificates.

### How about IPv6?

IPv6 record is added in `r.forwarddomain.net` so subdomain redirects will simply work with IPv6. We don't guarantee that its IPv6 address will be persistent though. See [#2](https://github.com/willnode/forward-domain/issues/2#issuecomment-1003831835) for apex domains setup.

### What records do we keep?

We only keep caches of DNS records and SSL certs. This also means we can see how many users and what domains are using our service from the software cache, but that's all. We don't keep log traffic nor keep any user data anywhere on our server.

### How can I support this service?

Star our repo and spread the word, please :)
